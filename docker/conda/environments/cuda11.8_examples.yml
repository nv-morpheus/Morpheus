# Additional dependencies needed by a some of the Morpheus examples.
# The intended usage is to first create the conda environment from the `cuda11.8_dev.yml` file, and then update the
# env with this file. ex:
#   mamba install -n base -c conda-forge conda-merge
#   conda run -n base --live-stream conda-merge docker/conda/environments/cuda${CUDA_VER}_dev.yml \
#     docker/conda/environments/cuda${CUDA_VER}_examples.yml  > .tmp/merged.yml \
#     && mamba env update -n morpheus --file ./merged.yml

# Anomalous Behavior Profiling (ABP)

# Model Overview

## Description:
* This model is an example of a binary XGBoost classifier to differentiate between anomalous GPU behavior, such as cryptocurrency mining / GPU malware, and non-anomalous GPU-based workflows (for example, ML/DL training). This model is for demonstration purposes and not for production usage. <br>

# Subcards

## Model Card ++ Bias Subcard

### What is the language balance of the model validation data?
* English

### What is the geographic origin language balance of the model validation data?
* UK

### Individuals from the following adversely impacted (protected classes) groups participate in model design and testing.
* Not Applicable

### Describe measures taken to mitigate against unwanted bias.
* Not Applicable

## Model Card ++ Explainability Subcard

### Name example applications and use cases for this model.
* The model is primarily designed for testing purposes and serves as a small pre-trained model specifically used to evaluate and validate the phishing detection pipeline. Its application is focused on assessing the effectiveness of the pipeline rather than being intended for broader use cases or specific applications beyond testing.

### Intended Users.
* This model is designed for developers seeking to test the phishing detection pipeline with a small pre-trained model.

### Name who is intended to benefit from this model.
* The intended beneficiaries of this model are developers who aim to test the performance and functionality of the phishing pipeline using synthetic datasets. It may not be suitable or provide significant value for real-world phishing messages.

### Describe the model output.
* This model output can be used as a binary result, Phishing/Spam or Benign

### Describe how this model works.
* A BERT model gets fine-tuned with the dataset and in the inference it predicts one of the binary classes. Phishing/Spam or Benign.

### List the technical limitations of the model.
* For different email/SMS types and content, different models need to be trained.

### Has this been verified to have met prescribed NVIDIA standards?
* Yes

### What performance metrics were used to affirm the model's performance?
* F1

### What are the potential known risks to users and stakeholders?
* N/A

### Link the relevant end user license agreement
* [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

## Model Card ++ Safety & Security Subcard

### Link the location of the repository for the training dataset.
* http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00228/smsspamcollection.zip

### Describe the life critical impact (if present).
* None

### Was model and dataset assessed for vulnerability for potential form of attack?
* No

### Name applications for the model.
* The primary application for this model is testing the Morpheus phishing detection pipeline

### Name use case restrictions for the model.
* This pretrained model's use case is restricted to testing the Morpheus pipeline and may not be suitable for other applications.

### Is the model and dataset compliant with National Classification Management Society (NCMS)?
* No

### Describe access restrictions

* The Principle of least privilege (PoLP) is applied limiting access for dataset generation and model development. Restrictions enforce dataset access during training, and dataset license constraints adhered to.

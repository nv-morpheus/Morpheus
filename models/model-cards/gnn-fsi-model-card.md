# Model Overview

### Description:
* This model shows an application of a graph neural network for fraud detection in a credit card transaction graph. A transaction dataset that includes three types of nodes, transaction, client, and merchant nodes is used for modeling. A combination of `GraphSAGE` along `XGBoost` is used to identify frauds in the transaction networks. This model is for demonstration purposes and not for production usage. <br>

## Model Architecture:
It uses a bipartite heterogeneous graph representation as input for `GraphSAGE` for feature learning and `XGBoost` as a classifier. Since the input graph is heterogeneous, a heterogeneous implementation of `GraphSAGE` (HinSAGE) is used for feature embedding.<br>
**Architecture Type:**
* Graph Neural Network and Binary classification <br>

**Network Architecture:**
* GraphSAGE and XGBoost <br>

## Input
Transaction data with nodes including transaction, client, and merchant.<br>
**Input Parameters:**
* None <br>

**Input Format:**
* CSV format<br>

**Other Properties Related to Output:**
* None<br>

## Output
An anomalous score of transactions indicates a probability score of being a fraud.<br>
**Output Parameters:**
* None <br>

**Output Format:**
* CSV<br>

**Other Properties Related to Output:**
* None <br>

## Software Integration:
**Runtime:**
* Morpheus  <br>

**Supported Hardware Platforms:** <br>
* Ampere/Turing <br>

**Supported Operating Systems:** <br>
* Linux <br>

## Model Versions:
* 1.0 <br>

### How To Use This Model
This model is an example of a fraud detection pipeline using a graph neural network and gradient boosting trees. This can be further retrained or fine-tuned to be used for similar types of transaction networks with similar graph structures.

# Subcards
## Model Card ++ Bias Subcard

### Individuals from the following adversely impacted (protected classes) groups participate in model design and testing.
* Not Applicable

### Describe measures taken to mitigate against unwanted bias.
* Not Applicable

## Model Card ++ Explainability Subcard

### Name example applications and use cases for this model.
* The model is primarily designed for testing purposes and serves as a small pretrained model specifically used to evaluate and validate the GNN FSI pipeline. Its application is focused on assessing the effectiveness of the pipeline rather than being intended for broader use cases or specific applications beyond testing.

### Fill in the blank for the model technique.
* This model is designed for developers seeking to test the GNN fraud detection pipeline with a small pretrained model on a synthetic dataset.

### Intended Users.
* The intended beneficiaries of this model are developers who aim to test the performance and functionality of the GNN fraud detection pipeline using synthetic datasets. It may not be suitable or provide significant value for real-world transactions.

### Describe the model output.
* This model outputs fraud probability score b/n (0 & 1).

### Describe how this model works.
* The model uses a bipartite heterogeneous graph representation as input for `GraphSAGE` for feature learning and `XGBoost` as a classifier. Since the input graph is heterogeneous, a heterogeneous implementation of `GraphSAGE` (HinSAGE) is used for feature embedding.

### List the technical limitations of the model.
* This model version requires a transactional data schema with entities (user, merchant, transaction) as requirement for the model.

### Has this been verified to have met prescribed NVIDIA standards?
* Yes

### What performance metrics were used to affirm the model's performance?
* Area under ROC curve and Accuracy

### What are the potential known risks to users and stakeholders?
* None

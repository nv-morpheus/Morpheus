# Model Overview

### Description:
* This model shows an application of a graph neural network for fraud detection in a credit card transaction graph. A transaction dataset that includes three types of nodes, transaction, client, and merchant nodes is used for modeling. A combination of `GraphSAGE` along `XGBoost` is used to identify frauds in the transaction networks. <br>

## Model Architecture:
It uses a bipartite heterogeneous graph representation as input for `GraphSAGE` for feature learning and `XGBoost` as a classifier. Since the input graph is heterogeneous, a heterogeneous implementation of `GraphSAGE` (HinSAGE) is used for feature embedding.<br>

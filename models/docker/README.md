# Morpheus Triton Server Models Container

The Morpheus Triton Server Models Container builds upon the [NVIDIA Triton Inference Server](https://developer.nvidia.com/triton-inference-server) container by adding the Morpheus pre-trained models.

## Building the Container
To build the container with the default arguments, run the following command from the root of the Morpheus repository:
```bash
./models/docker/build_container.sh
```

This will build a container tagged as `nvcr.io/nvidia/morpheus/morpheus-tritonserver-models:<Morpheus Version>`.

### Environment Variable Arguments
The `build_container.sh` script accepts the following environment variables to customize the build:
- `MORPHEUS_ROOT`: File path to the root of the Morpheus repository, if undefined the script will infer the value based on the script's location.
- `MORPHEUS_ROOT_HOST`: Relative path from the script working directory to the root of the Morpheus repository on the host. This should not need to be set so long as `MORPHEUS_ROOT` is set correctly.
- `FROM_IMAGE`: The base Triton Inference Server container image to use, defaults to `nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver`.
- `FROM_IMAGE_TAG`: The tag of the base Triton Inference Server container image to use.
- `DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME`: The name of the resulting container image, defaults to `nvcr.io/nvidia/morpheus/morpheus-tritonserver-models`.
- `DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG`: The tag of the resulting container image, defaults to the current Morpheus version.
- `DOCKER_EXTRA_ARGS`: Additional arguments to pass to the `docker build` command.

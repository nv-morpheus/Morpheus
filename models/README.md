# Morpheus Models

Pretrained models for Morpheus with corresponding training, validation scripts, and datasets.

## Repo Structure
Every Morpheus use case has a directory, **`<use-case>-models`**, that contains the model files for the use case. Training and validation datasets and scripts are also provided in [`datasets`](./datasets/), [`training-tuning-scripts`](./training-tuning-scripts/), and [`validation-inference-scripts`](./validation-inference-scripts/). Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) version of the training and fine-tuning scripts are also provided.

The `triton_model_repo` contains the necessary directory structure and configuration files in order to run the Morpheus Models in Triton Inference Server. This includes symlinks to the above-mentioned model files along with corresponding Triton configuration files (`.pbtxt`). More information on how to deploy this repository to Triton can be found in the [README](./triton-model-repo/README.md).

Models can also be published to an [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) server and deployed to Triton using the [MLflow Triton plugin](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/tree/main/deploy/mlflow-triton-plugin). The [MLflow](./mlflow/README.md) directory contains information on how to set up a Docker container to run an MLflow server for publishing Morpheus models and deploying them to Triton.

# Model Card Info
## Sensitive Information Detection (SID)
### Model Overview
SID is a classifier, designed to detect sensitive information (for example, AWS credentials, GitHub credentials) in unencrypted data. This example model classifies text containing these 10 categories of sensitive information- address, bank account, credit card number, email address, government id number, full name, password, phone number, secret keys, and usernames.
### Model Architecture
Compact BERT-mini transformer model
### Training
Training consisted of fine-tuning the original pretrained [model from Google](https://huggingface.co/google/bert_uncased_L-4_H-256_A-4). The labeled training dataset is 2 million synthetic PCAP payloads generated using the [faker package](https://github.com/joke2k/faker) to mimic sensitive and benign data found in nested JSON objects from web APIs and environmental variables.
### How To Use This Model
This model is an example of customized transformer-based sensitive information detection. It can be further fine-tuned for specific detection needs or retrained for alternative categorizations using the fine-tuning scripts in the repo.
#### Input
English text from PCAP payloads
#### Output
Multi-label sequence classification for 10 sensitive information categories
### Generating TRT Models from ONNX
The ONNX to TensorRT conversion utility requires additional packages, which can be installed using the following command:
```bash
conda env update --solver=libmamba -n morpheus --file conda/environments/model-utils_cuda-125_arch-x86_64.yaml
```
For the best performance you need to compile a TensorRT engine file on each machine that it will be run on. To facilitate this, Morpheus contains a utility to input an ONNX file and export the TensorRT engine file. Sample command to generate the TensorRT engine file -
```bash
morpheus --log_level=info tools onnx-to-trt --input_model sid-models/sid-minibert-20230424.onnx --output_model ./model.plan --batches 1 8 --batches 1 16 --batches 1 32 --seq_length 256 --max_workspace_size 16000
```
Note: If you get an out-of-memory error, reduce the `--max_workspace_size` argument until it will successfully run.

## Digital Fingerprinting (DFP)
### Model Overview
This use case is currently implemented to detect changes in users' behavior that indicate a change from a human to a machine or a machine to a human. The model is an ensemble of an Autoencoder and fast Fourier transform reconstruction.
### Model Architecture
The model is an ensemble of an Autoencoder and a fast Fourier transform reconstruction. The reconstruction loss of new log data through the trained Autoencoder is used as an anomaly score. Concurrently, the timestamps of user/entity activity are used for a time series analysis to flag activity with poor reconstruction after a fast Fourier transform.
### Training
The Autoencoder is trained on a baseline benign period of user activity.
### How To Use This Model
This model is one example of an Autoencoder trained from a baseline for benign activity from synthetic `user-123` and `role-g`. This model combined with validation data from Morpheus examples can be used to test the DFP Morpheus pipeline. It has little utility outside of testing.
### Input
aws-cloudtrail logs
### Output
Anomalous score of Autoencoder, Binary classification of time series anomaly detection

## Fraud Detection
### Model Overview
This model shows an application of a graph neural network for fraud detection in a credit card transaction graph. A transaction dataset that includes three types of nodes, transaction, client, and merchant nodes is used for modeling. A combination of `GraphSAGE` along `XGBoost` is used to identify frauds in the transaction networks.
### Model Architecture
It uses a bipartite heterogeneous graph representation as input for `GraphSAGE` for feature learning and `XGBoost` as a classifier. Since the input graph is heterogeneous, a heterogeneous implementation of `GraphSAGE` (HinSAGE) is used for feature embedding.
### Training
A training data consists of raw 753 labeled credit card transaction data with data augmentation in a total of 12053 labeled transaction data. The `GraphSAGE` is trained to output embedded representation of transactions out of the graph. The `XGBoost` is trained using the embedded features as a binary classifier to classify fraud and genuine transactions.
### How To Use This Model
This model is an example of a fraud detection pipeline using a graph neural network and gradient boosting trees. This can be further retrained or fine-tuned to be used for similar types of transaction networks with similar graph structures.
#### Input
Transaction data with nodes including transaction, client, and merchant.
#### Output
An anomalous score of transactions indicates a probability score of being a fraud.

## Ransomware Detection via AppShield
### Model Overview
This model shows an application of DOCA AppShield to use data from volatile memory to classify processes as ransomware or benign. This model uses a sliding window over time and feeds derived data into a random forest classifiers of various lengths depending on the amount of data collected.
### Model Architecture
The model uses input from Volatility plugins in DOCA AppShield to aggregate and derive features over snapshots in time. The features are used as input into three random forest binary classifiers.
### Training
Training data consists of 87968 labeled AppShield processes from 32 snapshots collected from 256 unique benign and ransomware activities.
### How To Use This Model
Combined with host data from DOCA AppShield, this model can be used to detect ransomware. A training notebook is also included so that users can update the model as more labeled data is collected.
#### Input
Snapshots collected from DOCA AppShield
#### Output
For each `process_id` and snapshot there is a probability score between 1 and 0, where 1 is ransomware and 0 is benign.

## Root Cause Analysis
### Model Overview
Root cause analysis is a binary classifier differentiating between ordinary logs and errors/problems/root causes in the log files.
### Model Architecture
BERT-base uncased transformer model
### Training
Training consisted of fine-tuning the original pre-trained [model from google](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased). The labeled dataset is Linux kernel logs, and it has two parts. Kernel errors and new errors. Kernel logs will be split into two parts so that the new and unseen error logs can be appended to the test set after the split to later check if the model can catch them despite not seeing such errors in the training.
### How To Use This Model
This model is an example of customized transformer-based root cause analysis. It can be further fine-tuned for specific root cause analysis or predictive maintenance needs and of your enterprise using the fine-tuning scripts in the repo. The hyper parameters can be optimised to adjust to get the best results with your dataset. The aim is to get the model to predict some false positives that could be previously unknown error types. Users can use this root cause analysis method with other log types too. If they have known failures in their logs, they can use them to train along with ordinary logs and can detect other root causes they weren't aware of before.
#### Input
Kernel logs
#### Output
Binary sequence classification as ordinary or root cause

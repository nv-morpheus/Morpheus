All objects related to building and running a pipeline.
"""

# Note: The pipeline module is unique in that we re-export all of the classes and functions from the submodules. To
# avoid circular imports, we must import the classes in a specific order. And in each submodule, we should never import
# the from pipeline submodules. Instead, we should import from the parent module as a namespace package and then use the
# fully qualified name to access the classes. For example, in morpheus/pipeline/stage.py:
# Do not do this:
# ```
# from morpheus.pipeline.stage_base import StageBase
# ```
# Instead, do this:
# ```
# import morpheus.pipeline as _pipeline  # pylint: disable=cyclic-import
# class Stage(_pipeline.StageBase):
# ```

# These must be imported in a specific order
# isort: off

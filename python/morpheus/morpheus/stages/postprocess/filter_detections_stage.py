@register_stage("filter")
class FilterDetectionsStage(GpuAndCpuMixin, SinglePortStage):
    """
    Filter message by a classification threshold.

    The FilterDetectionsStage is used to filter rows from a dataframe based on values in a tensor using a specified
    criteria. Rows in the `meta` dataframe are excluded if their associated value in the `probs` array is less than or
    equal to `threshold`.

    This stage can operate in two different modes set by the `copy` argument.
    When the `copy` argument is `True` (default), rows that meet the filter criteria are copied into a new dataframe.
    When `False` sliced views are used instead.

    Setting `copy=True` should be used when the number of matching records is expected to be both high and in
    non-adjacent rows. In this mode, the stage will generate only one output message for each incoming message,
    regardless of the size of the input and the number of matching records. However this comes at the cost of needing to
    allocate additional memory and perform the copy.
    Note: In most other stages, messages emitted contain a reference to the original `MessageMeta` emitted into the
    pipeline by the source stage. When using copy mode this won't be the case and could cause the original `MessageMeta`
    to be deallocated after this stage.

    Setting `copy=False` should be used when either the number of matching records is expected to be very low or are
    likely to be contained in adjacent rows. In this mode, slices of contiguous blocks of rows are emitted in multiple
    output messages. Performing a slice is relatively low-cost, however for each incoming message the number of emitted
    messages could be high (in the worst case scenario as high as half the number of records in the incoming message).
    Depending on the downstream stages, this can cause performance issues, especially if those stages need to acquire
    the Python GIL.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : `morpheus.config.Config`
        Pipeline configuration instance.
    threshold : float
        Threshold to classify, default is 0.5.
    copy : bool
        Whether or not to perform a copy.
    filter_source : `morpheus.common.FilterSource`, case_sensitive = False
        Indicate if we are operating on is an output tensor or a field in the DataFrame.
        Choosing `Auto` will default to `TENSOR` when the incoming message contains output tensorts and `DATAFRAME`
        otherwise.
    field_name : str
        Name of the tensor or DataFrame column to use as the filter criteria

**General architectural ideas**

We build three libraries:
- `libmorpheus` : Defines all the python aware library code for Morpheus, and interface proxies for python modules.
  - Interface proxies are designed to provide a single consolidated point of interaction between the Morpheus library code and their associated pybind11 module definitions.
  - Please avoid declaring ad-hoc functions/interfaces that link to python modules.
- `libmorpheus_utils` : MatX and table manipulation functions.
- `libcudf_helpers` : Small bridge module used to extract Cython based DataFrame, and series information from cuDF.


Python modules should be defined in `_lib/src/python_modules`, with an associated CMake declaration in
`_lib/cmake/<module_name>.cmake` which can be included in `_lib/CMakeLists.txt`.

# Morpheus 22.04.00 (27 Apr 2022)

## Initial Public Release

Morpheus is being provided as OSS and is now generally available on GitHub as well as NGC (NVIDIA GPU Cloud). Morpheus is still early software and a work in progress. Breaking changes (including breaking API changes) are to be expected

### Highlights

- GNN (Graph Neural Networking) based workflow for fraud detection
- Transformer based workflow for log parsing
- Updated Morpheus to use the features for pipeline development

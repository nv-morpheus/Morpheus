# Developer Guides

## Morpheus Stages

Morpheus includes a number of pre-defined stage implementations to choose from when building a custom
pipeline, each of which can be included and configured to suit your application.

- [List of available Morpheus stages](../stages/morpheus_stages.md)

However, there are likely going to be situations that require writing a custom stage. Morpheus stages are written in
Python and optionally may include a C++ implementation. The following guides outline how to create your own stages
in both Python and C++.

- [Simple Python Stage](./guides/1_simple_python_stage.md)
- [Real-World Application: Phishing Detection](./guides/2_real_world_phishing.md)
- [Simple C++ Stage](./guides/3_simple_cpp_stage.md)
- [Creating a C++ Source Stage](./guides/4_source_cpp_stage.md)

## Morpheus Modules

Morpheus includes, as of version 23.03, a number of pre-defined module implementations to choose from when building a 
custom pipeline. Modules can be thought of as units of work, which exist at a lower level than stages. Modules can 
be defined, registered, chained, nested, and loaded at runtime. Modules can be written in Python or C++.

- [List of available Morpheus modules](../modules/morpheus_modules.md)

However, there are likely going to be situations that require writing a custom module, either for creating your own 
reusable work units, or for creating a new compound module from a set of existing primitives. The following guides 
will walk through the process of creating a custom module in Python and C++.

- [Python Module](./guides/7_python_modules.md)
- [C++ Module](./guides/8_cpp_modules.md)

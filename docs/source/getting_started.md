# Getting Started with Morpheus

There are two ways to get started with Morpheus:
- [Building the Morpheus Docker container](#building-the-morpheus-container)
- [Building Morpheus from source](./developer_guide/contributing.md#building-from-source)


## Requirements
- Volta architecture GPU or better
- [CUDA 12.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-1-0-download-archive)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [The NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker)
- [NVIDIA Triton Inference Server](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/tritonserver) `23.06` or higher

> **Note about Docker:**
>
> The Morpheus documentation and examples assume that the [Manage Docker as a non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user) post install step has been performed allowing Docker commands to be executed by a non-root user. This is not strictly necessary so long as the current user has `sudo` privileges to execute Docker commands.

## Building the Morpheus Container
### Clone the Repository

```bash
MORPHEUS_ROOT=$(pwd)/morpheus
git clone https://github.com/nv-morpheus/Morpheus.git $MORPHEUS_ROOT
cd $MORPHEUS_ROOT
```

### Git LFS

The large model and data files in this repo are stored using [Git Large File Storage (LFS)](https://git-lfs.github.com/). Only those files which are strictly needed to run Morpheus are downloaded by default when the repository is cloned.

The `scripts/fetch_data.py` script can be used to fetch the Morpheus pre-trained models, and other files required for running the training/validation scripts and example pipelines.

If any data-related issues occur when running the pipeline, the script should be rerun outside the container.

Usage of the script is as follows:
```bash
scripts/fetch_data.py fetch <dataset> [<dataset>...]
```

At time of writing the defined datasets are:
* all - Metaset includes all others
* docs - Graphics needed for documentation
* examples - Data needed by scripts in the `examples` subdir
* models - Morpheus models (largest dataset)
* tests - Data used by unittests
* validation - Subset of the models dataset needed by some unittests

To download just the examples and models:
```bash
scripts/fetch_data.py fetch examples models
```

To download the data needed for unittests:
```bash
scripts/fetch_data.py fetch tests validation
```

If `Git LFS` is not installed before cloning the repository, the `scripts/fetch_data.py` script will fail. If this is the case, follow the instructions for installing `Git LFS` from [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/), and then run the following command:
```bash
git lfs install
```

### Build the Container

To assist in building the Morpheus container, several scripts have been provided in the `./docker` directory. To build the "release" container, run the following:

```bash
./docker/build_container_release.sh
```

By default this will create an image named `nvcr.io/nvidia/morpheus/morpheus:${MORPHEUS_VERSION}-runtime` where `$MORPHEUS_VERSION` is replaced by the output of `git describe --tags --abbrev=0`. You can specify a different Docker image name and tag by passing the script the `DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME`, and `DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables respectively.

To run the built "release" container, use the following:

```bash
./docker/run_container_release.sh
```

The `./docker/run_container_release.sh` script accepts the same `DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME`, and `DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables that the `./docker/build_container_release.sh` script does. For example, to run version `v24.06.00` use the following:

```bash
DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG="v24.06.00-runtime" ./docker/run_container_release.sh
```

## Launching Triton Server

Many of the validation tests and example workflows require a Triton server to function. In a new terminal, from the root of the Morpheus repo, use the following command to launch a Docker container for Triton loading all of the included pre-trained models:

```bash
docker run --rm -ti --gpus=all -p8000:8000 -p8001:8001 -p8002:8002 \
  -v $PWD/models:/models \
  nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:23.06-py3 \
  tritonserver --model-repository=/models/triton-model-repo \
    --exit-on-error=false \
    --log-info=true \
    --strict-readiness=false \
    --disable-auto-complete-config
```

This will launch Triton using the default network ports (8000 for HTTP, 8001 for GRPC, and 8002 for metrics), loading all of the examples models in the Morpheus repo.

Note: The above command is useful for testing out Morpheus, however it does load several models into GPU memory, which at time of writing consumes roughly 2GB of GPU memory. Production users should consider only loading the specific model(s) they plan on using with the `--model-control-mode=explicit` and `--load-model` flags. For example to launch Triton only loading the `abp-nvsmi-xgb` model:
```bash
docker run --rm -ti --gpus=all -p8000:8000 -p8001:8001 -p8002:8002 \
  -v $PWD/models:/models \
  nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:23.06-py3 \
  tritonserver --model-repository=/models/triton-model-repo \
    --exit-on-error=false \
    --log-info=true \
    --strict-readiness=false \
    --disable-auto-complete-config \
    --model-control-mode=explicit \
    --load-model abp-nvsmi-xgb
```

## Running Morpheus

To run Morpheus, users will need to choose from the Morpheus Command Line Interface (CLI) or Python interface. Which interface to use depends on the user's needs, amount of customization, and operating environment. More information on each interface can be found below.

For full example pipelines using both the Python API and command line interface, refer to the [Morpheus Examples](./examples.md).

### Morpheus Python Interface

The Morpheus Python interface allows users to configure their pipelines using a Python script file. This is ideal for users who are working in a Jupyter Notebook, and users who need complex initialization logic. Documentation on using both the Morpheus Python & C++ APIs can be found in the [Morpheus Developer Guide](./developer_guide/guides.md).

### Morpheus Command Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI allows users to completely configure a Morpheus pipeline directly from a terminal. This is ideal for users configuring a pipeline in Kubernetes. The Morpheus CLI can be invoked using the `morpheus` command and is capable of running linear pipelines as well as additional tools. Instructions for using the CLI can be queried directly in the terminal using `morpheus --help`:

```bash
$ morpheus --help
Usage: morpheus [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --debug / --no-debug            [default: no-debug]
  --log_level [CRITICAL|FATAL|ERROR|WARN|WARNING|INFO|DEBUG]
                                  Specify the logging level to use.  [default:
                                  WARNING]
  --log_config_file FILE          Config file to use to configure logging. Use
                                  only for advanced situations. Can accept
                                  both JSON and ini style configurations
  --plugin TEXT                   Adds a Morpheus CLI plugin. Can either be a
                                  module name or path to a python module
  --version                       Show the version and exit.
  --help                          Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  run    Run one of the available pipelines
  tools  Run a utility tool
```

Each command in the CLI has its own help information. Use `morpheus [command] [...sub-command] --help` to get instructions for each command and sub command. For example:

```bash
$ morpheus run pipeline-nlp inf-triton --help
Configuring Pipeline via CLI
Usage: morpheus run pipeline-nlp inf-triton [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --model_name TEXT               Model name in Triton to send messages to
                                  [required]
  --server_url TEXT               Triton server URL (IP:Port)  [required]
  --force_convert_inputs BOOLEAN  Instructs this stage to forcibly convert all
                                  input types to match what Triton is
                                  expecting. Even if this is set to `False`,
                                  automatic conversion will be done only if
                                  there would be no data loss (i.e. int32 ->
                                  int64).  [default: False]
  --use_shared_memory BOOLEAN     Whether or not to use CUDA Shared IPC Memory
                                  for transferring data to Triton. Using CUDA
                                  IPC reduces network transfer time but
                                  requires that Morpheus and Triton are
                                  located on the same machine  [default:
                                  False]
  --help                          Show this message and exit.  [default:
                                  False]
```

Several examples on using the Morpheus CLI can be found in the [Basic Usage](./basics/overview.rst) guide along with the other [Morpheus Examples](./examples.md).

#### CLI Stage Configuration

When configuring a pipeline via the CLI, you start with the command `morpheus run pipeline` and then list the stages in order from start to finish. The order that the commands are placed in will be the order that data flows from start to end. The output of each stage will be linked to the input of the next. For example, to build a simple pipeline that reads from Kafka, deserializes messages, serializes them, and then writes to a file, use the following:

```bash
morpheus --log_level=INFO run pipeline-nlp from-kafka --bootstrap_servers localhost:9092 --input_topic test_pcap deserialize serialize to-file --filename .tmp/temp_out.json --overwrite
```

The output should contain lines similar to:
```
====Building Segment: linear_segment_0====
Added source: <from-kafka-0; KafkaSourceStage(bootstrap_servers=localhost:9092, input_topic=('test_pcap',), group_id=morpheus, client_id=None, poll_interval=10millis, disable_commit=False, disable_pre_filtering=False, auto_offset_reset=AutoOffsetReset.LATEST, stop_after=0, async_commits=True)>
  └─> morpheus.MessageMeta
Added stage: <deserialize-1; DeserializeStage(ensure_sliceable_index=True)>
  └─ morpheus.MessageMeta -> morpheus.MultiMessage
Added stage: <serialize-2; SerializeStage(include=(), exclude=('^ID$', '^_ts_'), fixed_columns=True)>
  └─ morpheus.MultiMessage -> morpheus.MessageMeta
Added stage: <to-file-3; WriteToFileStage(filename=.tmp/temp_out.json, overwrite=True, file_type=FileTypes.Auto, include_index_col=True, flush=False)>
  └─ morpheus.MessageMeta -> morpheus.MessageMeta
====Building Segment Complete!====
====Pipeline Started====
```

This is important because, when the log level is set to `INFO` and above, it shows you the order of the stages and the output type of each one. Since some stages cannot accept all types of inputs, Morpheus will report an error if you have configured your pipeline incorrectly. For example, if we run the same command as above but forget the `serialize` stage, Morpheus should output an error similar to:

```bash
$ morpheus run pipeline-nlp from-kafka --bootstrap_servers localhost:9092 --input_topic test_pcap deserialize to-file --filename .tmp/temp_out.json --overwrite
Configuring Pipeline via CLI
Starting pipeline via CLI... Ctrl+C to Quit
E20221214 14:53:17.425515 452045 controller.cpp:62] exception caught while performing update - this is fatal - issuing kill
E20221214 14:53:17.425714 452045 context.cpp:125] rank: 0; size: 1; tid: 140065439217216; fid: 0x7f6144041000: set_exception issued; issuing kill to current runnable. Exception msg: RuntimeError: The to-file stage cannot handle input of <class 'morpheus.messages.multi_message.MultiMessage'>. Accepted input types: (<class 'morpheus.messages.message_meta.MessageMeta'>,)
```

This indicates that the `to-file` stage cannot accept the input type of `morpheus.messages.multi_message.MultiMessage`. This is because the `to-file` stage has no idea how to write that class to a file; it only knows how to write messages of type `morpheus.messages.message_meta.MessageMeta`. To ensure you have a valid pipeline, examine at the `Accepted input types: (<class 'morpheus.messages.message_meta.MessageMeta'>,)` portion of the error message. This indicates you need a stage that converts from the output type of the `deserialize` stage, `morpheus.messages.multi_message.MultiMessage`, to `morpheus.messages.message_meta.MessageMeta`, which is exactly what the `serialize` stage does.

#### Pipeline Stages

The CLI allows for an easy way to query the available stages for each pipeline type. Refer to [Morpheus Stages](./stages/morpheus_stages.md) for more extensive documentation of the stages included in Morpheus.

> **Note**: While most stages are available from the CLI, a small subset of stages, and configuration options for stages are unavailable from the CLI and can only be used via the Python API.

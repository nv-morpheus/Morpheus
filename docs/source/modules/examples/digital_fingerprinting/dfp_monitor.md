This module function monitors the pipeline message flow rate.

### Configurable Parameters

| Key                         | Type    | Description                                                | Example Value | Default Value |
| ----------------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| `description`               | string  | Name to show for this Monitor Stage in the console window  | "Progress"    | `Progress`    |
| `silence_monitors`          | bool    | Silence the monitors on the console                        | True     | `False`        |
| `smoothing`                 | float   | Smoothing parameter to determine how much the throughput should be averaged | 0.01 | `0.05` |
| `unit`                      | string  | Units to show in the rate value                             | "messages"    | `messages`    |
| `delayed_start`             | bool    | When delayed_start is enabled, the progress bar will not be shown until the first message is received.

| `determine_count_fn_schema` | string  | Custom function for determining the count in a message      | "Progress"    | `Progress`    |

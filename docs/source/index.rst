Welcome to Morpheus Documentation
=================================

NVIDIA Morpheus is an open AI application framework that provides cybersecurity developers with a highly optimized AI framework and pre-trained AI capabilities that allow them to instantaneously inspect all IP traffic across their data center fabric. The Morpheus developer framework allows teams to build their own optimized pipelines that address cybersecurity and information security use cases. Bringing a new level of security to data centers, Morpheus provides development capabilities around dynamic protection, real-time telemetry, adaptive policies, and cyber defenses for detecting and remediating cybersecurity threats.

Features
--------

 * Built on RAPIDS
    * Built on the RAPIDS™ libraries, deep learning frameworks, and NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server, Morpheus simplifies
      the analysis of logs and telemetry to help detect and mitigate security threats.
 * AI Cybersecurity Capabilities
    * Deploy your own models using common deep learning frameworks. Or get a jump-start in building applications to
      identify leaked sensitive information, detect malware, and identify errors via logs by using one of NVIDIA's
      pre-trained and tested models.
 * Real-Time Telemetry
    * Morpheus can receive rich, real-time network telemetry from every NVIDIA® BlueField® DPU-accelerated server in the
      data center without impacting performance. Integrating the framework into a third-party cybersecurity offering
      brings the world's best AI computing to communication networks.
 * DPU-Connected
    * The NVIDIA BlueField Data Processing Unit (DPU) can be used as a telemetry agent for receiving critical data
      center communications into Morpheus. As an optional addition to Morpheus, BlueField DPU also extends static
      security logging to a sophisticated dynamic real-time telemetry model that evolves with new policies and threat
      intelligence.

# Example RabbitMQ stages
This example builds upon the `examples/developer_guide/2_2_rabbitmq` example adding a C++ implementation for the `RabbitMQSourceStage` along with adding package install scripts.

## Supported Environments
| Environment | Supported | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Conda | ✔ | |
| Morpheus Docker Container | ✔ | Requires launching the RabbitMQ container on the host |
| Morpheus Release Container | ✔ | Requires launching the RabbitMQ container on the host, and adding development packages to the container's Conda environment via `conda env update --solver=libmamba -n morpheus --file /workspace/conda/environments/dev_cuda-125_arch-x86_64.yaml` |
| Dev Container | ✘ |  |

## Installing Pika
The `RabbitMQSourceStage` and `WriteToRabbitMQStage` stages use the [pika](https://pika.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#) RabbitMQ client for Python. To install this into the current environment run:
```bash
pip install -r examples/developer_guide/4_rabbitmq_cpp_stage/requirements.txt
```

## Building the Example
There are two ways to build the example. The first is to build the examples along with Morpheus by passing the `-DMORPHEUS_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON` flag to CMake, for users using the `scripts/compile.sh` at the root of the Morpheus repo can do this by setting the `CMAKE_CONFIGURE_EXTRA_ARGS` environment variable:
```bash
CMAKE_CONFIGURE_EXTRA_ARGS="-DMORPHEUS_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON" ./scripts/compile.sh
```

The second is to build the example as a standalone project. From the root of the Morpheus repo execute:
```bash
cd examples/developer_guide/4_rabbitmq_cpp_stage
./compile.sh

# Optionally install the package into the current python environment
pip install ./
```

## Testing with a RabbitMQ container
Testing can be performed locally with the RabbitMQ supplied docker image from the [RabbitMQ container registry](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq/):
```bash
docker run --rm -it --hostname my-rabbit -p 15672:15672 -p 5672:5672 rabbitmq:3-management
```

The image can be verified with the web management console by opening http://localhost:15672 in a web browser. Enter "guest" for both the username and the password.

## Launch the reader
In a second terminal from the root of the Morpheus repo execute:
```bash
python examples/developer_guide/4_rabbitmq_cpp_stage/src/read_simple.py
```

This will read from a RabbitMQ exchange named 'logs', and write the results to `results.json`.

If no exchange named 'logs' exists in RabbitMQ it will be created.

## Launch the writer
In a third terminal from the root of the Morpheus repo execute:
```bash
python examples/developer_guide/4_rabbitmq_cpp_stage/src/write_simple.py
```

This will read JSON data from the `examples/data/email.jsonlines` file and publish the data into the 'logs' RabbitMQ exchange as a single message.

The `write_simple.py` script will exit as soon as the message is written to the queue. The `read_simple.py` script will continue reading from the queue until explicitly shut down with a control-C.

    "In this notebook, we will be building and running a DFP pipeline that performs training on Duo authentication logs. The goal is to train an autoencoder PyTorch model to recogize the patterns of users in the sample data. The model will then be used by a second Morpheus pipeline to generate anomaly scores for each individual log. These anomaly scores can be used by security teams to detect abnormal behavior when it happens so the proper action can be taken.\n",

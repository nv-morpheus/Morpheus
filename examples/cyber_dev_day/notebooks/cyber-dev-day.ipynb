    "# Cyber Developer Day 2024\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming essential tools in cybersecurity in part due to their ability to enhance the efficiency of cyber threat detection and response by accelerating analyst workflows. Prototyping and moving theses accelerated workflows into production can be daunting\n",
    "Cybersecurity remains among the top three challenges impacting every industry—from the public sector to financial services, telecommunications, retail, automotive, and more. Most CEOs believe organizations with the most advanced generative AI capabilities will have a competitive advantage and are looking for ways to incorporate this into their business. Adversaries are already using generative AI in their attacks, however, and much more can be done to harness this power for cyberdefense. This hands-on tutorial will focus on accelerating an exploitablity analysis workflow to increase analyst productivity and enhance cybersecurity defenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining the impact of a documented Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) on a specific project or container is a labor-intensive and manual task. This process involves the collection, comprehension, and synthesis of various pieces of information to ascertain whether immediate remediation, such as patching, is necessary upon the identification of a new CVE. Often, reasons cited for not updating a library affected by a CVE include the occurrence of scan false positives, the existence of mitigating factors, or the absence of necessary environments or dependencies for the exploit to be viable. Once an analyst has determined the library is not affected, a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document must be created to standardize and distribute the results. The efficiency of this process can be significantly enhanced through the deployment of an event-driven LLM agent pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team developed a cybersecurity vulnerability analysis tool to aid in assessing the exploitability of CVEs in specific projects and containers. The following tutorial shows step-by-step how to leverage LLMs, RAG, and agents to create toy version and microservice running LLM-powered CVE exploitability analysis.\n",
    "Students can experiment with the different modules to expand on this use case or leverage these modular pieces to construct a new pipeline of their own.\n",

    "In this lab, we will be using [NVIDIA NeMo](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/) as our generative AI platform. NeMo is a cloud-native framework for building, customizing and deploying generative AI models with a familiar ChatGPT-like interface. Utilizing NeMo (or any other generative AI service) in our pipelines allows us to offload the heavy lifting of language model inference to a dedicated service, freeing up our own resources for other tasks. All requests to the NeMo service are made via an HTTP API, which allows us to easily integrate it into our existing codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the process of interacting with the NeMo service, the NeMo team provides a Python client library (`nemollm`) that wraps the HTTP API. This library provides a simple interface for making requests to the NeMo service, and handles the details of making HTTP requests and parsing the responses. This allows us to focus on the high-level logic of our application, rather than the low-level details of making HTTP requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before sending requests to the NeMo service, we need to set up a NeMo connection object, `conn` which is shown below. We will use the `generate` method of the connection object to send requests to the NeMo service for the remainder of this section.\n"

    "Now that we have the task generation for this workflow ready, how can we automate getting the answers for our checklist items?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 - Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to build a language model-based system that accesses external knowledge sources to complete tasks. In [Section 1.3](#1.3---Prompt-Templating), we added additional CVE details into the prompt by hand. While this strategy can be effective for adding additional context for very specific items like CVE Details, it requires apriori knowledge of what details to include (like those from NVD). When you would like to help your LLM with its query by adding more context in real-time, you're ready for RAG (Retreival Augmented Generation).\n",
    "\n",
    "When a query or checklist item is posed to an LLM equipped with RAG, the model first consults the vector database to find relevant information related to the query. This retrieved data is then combined with the original question and fed back into the LLM. With this enriched context, the LLM can generate a more accurate and informed response, potentially including evidence or reasoning based on the newly incorporated data. This approach not only improves the quality of the LLM's outputs and for our tool gives it access to project and container specific information to determine CVE exploitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 - Building the Vector Database\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to having a query and LLM, RAG requires additional information to be stored in a vector database. One mechanism of finding the proper information from the database is to first embed the query into the same vector space and retreive the top most similiar items via a distance metric. The additional information is then presented in the prompt of the LLM. The neighboring vectors in the database are said to be \"semantically similiar\" to the query and likely relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our demonstration purposes, we would like our LLM to be able to access the code repository of the project we're interested in checking for exploitable CVEs. The first step is transforming the specific repo into a vector database.\n"

    "1. The LLM models fail to work on some questions which can generate errors in the pipeline\n",

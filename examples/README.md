## Environments
Morpheus supports multiple environments, each environment is intended to support a given use-case. Each example documents which environments it is able to run in. With the exception of the Morpheus Release Container, the examples require fetching both the `datasets` and `examples` dataset via the `fetch_data.sh` script:
```bash
git lfs install
./scripts/fetch_data.py fetch examples datasets
```

The following are the supported environments:
| Environment | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| [Conda](../docs/source/developer_guide/contributing.md#build-in-a-conda-environment) | Morpheus is built from source by the end user, and dependencies are installed via the Conda package manager. |
| [Morpheus Docker Container](../docs/source/developer_guide/contributing.md#build-in-docker-container) | A Docker container that is built from source by the end user, Morpheus is then built from source from within the container. |
| [Morpheus Release Container](../docs/source/getting_started.md#building-the-morpheus-container) | Pre-built Docker container that is built from source by the Morpheus team, and is available for download from the [NGC container registry](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/morpheus/containers/morpheus/tags), or can be built locally from source. |
| [Dev Container](../.devcontainer/README.md) | A [Dev Container](https://containers.dev/) that is built from source by the end user, Morpheus is then built from source from within the container. |

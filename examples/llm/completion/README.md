## Background Information

### Purpose

The primary goal of this example is to showcase the creation of a pipeline that integrates an LLM service with Morpheus. Although this example features a single implementation, the pipeline and its components are versatile and can be adapted to various scenarios with unique requirements. The following highlights different customization points within the pipeline and the specific choices made for this example:

#### LLM Service

- The pipeline is designed to support any LLM service that adheres to our LLMService interface. Compatible services include OpenAI, or even local execution using llama-cpp-python.

#### Downstream Tasks

- Post LLM execution, the model's output can be leveraged for various tasks, including model training, analysis, or simulating an attack. In this particular example, we have simplified the implementation and focused solely on the LLMEngine.

### Pipeline Implementation

This example Morpheus pipeline is built using the following components:

- **InMemorySourceStage**: Manages LLM queries in a DataFrame.
- **DeserializationStage**: Converts MessageMeta objects into ControlMessages required by the LLMEngine.
- **LLMEngineStage**: Encompasses the core LLMEngine functionality.
    - An `ExtracterNode` extracts the questions from the DataFrame.
    - A `PromptTemplateNode` converts data and a template into the final inputs for the LLM.
    - The LLM executes using an `LLMGenerateNode` to run the LLM queries.
    - Finally, the responses are incorporated back into the ControlMessage using a `SimpleTaskHandler`.
- **InMemorySinkStage**: Store the results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the pipeline, ensure that the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set.

#### Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies.

```bash
conda env update --solver=libmamba \
  -n ${CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV} \
  --file ./conda/environments/examples_cuda-128_arch-$(arch).yaml
```

### Running the Morpheus Pipeline

The top level entrypoint to each of the LLM example pipelines is `examples/llm/main.py`. This script accepts a set
of Options and a Pipeline to run. Baseline options are below, and for the purposes of this document we'll assume a
pipeline option of `completion`:

### Run example:

```bash
python examples/llm/main.py completion [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
```

#### Commands:

- `pipeline`

##### Options:
- `--use_cpu_only`
    - **Description**: Run in CPU only mode
    - **Default**: `False`

- `--num_threads INTEGER RANGE`
    - **Description**: Number of internal pipeline threads to use.
    - **Default**: `12`

- `--pipeline_batch_size INTEGER RANGE`
    - **Description**: Internal batch size for the pipeline. Can be much larger than the model batch size.
      Also used for Kafka consumers.
    - **Default**: `1024`

- `--model_max_batch_size INTEGER RANGE`
    - **Description**: Max batch size to use for the model.
    - **Default**: `64`

- `--repeat_count INTEGER RANGE`
    - **Description**: Number of times to repeat the input query. Useful for testing performance.
    - **Default**: `64`

- `--llm_service [OpenAI]`
    - **Description**: LLM service to issue requests to.
    - **Default**: `OpenAI`

- `--help`
    - **Description**: Show the help message with options and commands details.

### Running Morpheus Pipeline with OpenAI LLM service

```bash
python examples/llm/main.py completion pipeline
```
